<summary><h2>Projects & Selected Work</h2></summary>

- OSMAS — Open Source Malware Acquisition System  
  - Led architecture and development of OSMAS to automate malware collection, triage, and labeling. Built ingestion pipelines, metadata extraction, deduplication logic, and sandbox integration for dynamic behavioral capture.  
  - Tech: Python, Celery, MongoDB, Cuckoo.  
  - Outcome: Scaled ingestion and improved quality of detection rule development and telemetry.

- Malware Repository Management (111+M samples)  
  - Designed storage, indexing, and search strategies for a repository of 111+ million samples. Implemented metadata schema, sharding/indexing, and retention policies to enable large-scale threat hunting.  
  - Outcome: Reduced query latency and improved family attribution accuracy for cross-team threat intelligence.

- Detection Engineering — YARA & Behavioral Signatures  
  - Developed high-fidelity YARA rules and runtime behavioral signatures across Windows/macOS/Linux. Built CI validation against benign corpora and sandbox traces to measure false-positive rates.  
  - Outcome: Increased detection coverage with minimal false positives and contributed signatures to product feeds.

- Fuzzing & Automation (Python)  
  - Built Python fuzz harnesses and orchestration to test protocols and file formats, with automated triage and crash deduplication. Integrated fuzzer output into issue tracking for actionable remediation.  
  - Tech: Python, AFL/LibFuzzer wrappers, Celery, Selenium.

- C2 & Network Forensics Research  
  - Researched command-and-control (C2) patterns and developed network-level detection heuristics. Built PCAP analysis pipelines and behavior-based classifiers using UNSW-NB15 and custom labeled corpora.  
  - Outcome: Improved detection of staged beaconing and stealthy exfiltration.

- IoT Smart Agriculture (Patent)  
  - Co-inventor of an IoT-based Smart Agriculture Monitoring & Control device; responsible for edge data collection, secure communications, and anomaly detection modules.
